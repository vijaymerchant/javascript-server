# EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent
# coding styles between different editors and IDEs
# editorconfig.org
# Notes :
# Entries in square brackets ([]) are patterns of files the following rules should apply to. [Makefile] is a simple pattern 
#  with no wildcards that matches the name "Makefile" exactly. It refers to common makefiles.
# The end_of_line entry refers to the character(s) that is used to signify an end of a line.
#  LF stands for Line Feed (\n)
#  CR stands for Carriage Return (\r)
#  CRLF is simply CR followed by LF (i.e., \r\n)
#--------------------
# Properties :
#  indent_style = {space|tab}
#  indent_size = {4|tab}
#  tab_width = 2
#  end_of_line = {cr|lf|crlf}
#  charset = {utf-8|utf-16be|utf-16le|latin1}
#  trim_trailing_whitespace = false
#  insert_final_newline = true
#  max_line_length = 80
# ------------------
# Example :
# top-most EditorConfig file
# root = true
# 
# # Unix-style newlines with a newline ending every file
# [*]
# end_of_line = lf
# insert_final_newline = true
# 
# # 4 space indentation
# [*.py]
# indent_style = space
# indent_size = 4
# 
# # Tab indentation (no size specified)
# [*.js]
# indent_style = tab
# 
# # Indentation override for all JS under lib directory
# [lib/**.js]
# indent_style = space
# indent_size = 2
# 
# # Matches the exact files either package.json or .travis.yml
# [{package.json,.travis.yml}]
# indent_style = space
# indent_size = 2
# -----------------------------------

# indent_style: set to tab or space to use hard tabs or soft tabs respectively.
# indent_size: a whole number defining the number of columns used for each indentation level and the width of soft tabs (when supported). When set to tab, the value of tab_width (if specified) will be used.
# tab_width: a whole number defining the number of columns used to represent a tab character. This defaults to the value of indent_size and doesn't usually need to be specified.
# end_of_line: set to lf, cr, or crlf to control how line breaks are represented.
# charset: set to latin1, utf-8, utf-8-bom, utf-16be or utf-16le to control the character set.
# trim_trailing_whitespace: set to true to remove any whitespace characters preceding newline characters and false to ensure it doesn't.
# insert_final_newline: set to true to ensure file ends with a newline when saving and false to ensure it doesn't.
# root: special property that should be specified at the top of the file outside of any sections. Set to true to stop .editorconfig files search on current file.
