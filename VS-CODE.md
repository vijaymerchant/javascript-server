Question : Brief description about at least 5 features and 8 useful plugins of VS Code.
Answer :
Features :
1. Refactor Promises to Async/Await :  Typescript language service to automatically refactor code that uses Promise methods such as .then() or .catch() to instead use the async and await keywords.
                                       Async/await offers many advantages over promise methods including cleaner syntax, error handling, debugging, and readability.

2. Balance Inward/Outward : You can select a whole tag in VS Code by using the balance inward and balance outward Emmet commands. It's helpful to bind these commands to keyboard shortcuts, 
                            like Ctrl + Shift + Up Arrow for Balance Outward and Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow for Balance Inward.
                            
3. Pull Requests : The Github Pull Requests extension from Github allows you to view and interact with your Pull Requests directly from within VS Code.

4. Toggle Sidebar Focus : You can navigate in and out of the sidebar without ever touching the mouse. Use ⌃/⌘+ 0 to set focus to the Siebar and ⌃/⌘+ 1 to set it to the editor. 
                          On a Mac, you can use ⌃/⌘+ ⇣ to select a file in the Sidebar Explorer with your keyboard. On Windows just press the enter key.

5. Breadcrumbs : Use the Breadcrumbs feature in VS Code to quickly jump between folders, files and even sections in code without ever leaving your current tab.
                 To enable, select "Toggle Breadcrumbs" from the Command Palette.

Usefull plugins :
1. Auto Close Tag and Auto Rename Tag : Auto Close Tag automatically adds a closing tag, which saves you quite a lot of keystrokes over time, while Auto Rename Tag renames closed tags automatically.

2. Code Runner : Needing to try out a few lines of C# or JavaScript code. Rather than starting LINQPad for C# or Chrome dev tools for JavaScript, Code Runner can execute one or more highlighted lines of code inside Code.

3. Icon Fonts : The wonderful Visual Studio extension Glyphfriend isn't available for Code, but luckily, someone made Icon Fonts. It brings IntelliSense for referencing common icon fonts like FontAwesome and Glyphicons inside Code.

4. vscode-icons : Much like the File Icons extension we highlighted for Visual Studio, vscode-icons brings filetype icons into Code. You may think it doesn't matter, but that's only until you've tried it. File icons lets you navigate much faster.

5. Debugger for chrome : Chrome has features built in that make debugging a much better experience. This extension gives you all (or close to all) of those debugging features right inside of VS Code!

6. Bracket Pair Colorizor : Brackets are the bane of a developer's existence. With tons of nested code, it gets almost impossible to determine which brackets match up with each other. Bracket Pair Colorizer (as you might expect) colors matching brackets to make your code much more readable. 

7. Path Intellisense : In large projects, remembering specific file names and the directories your files are in can get tricky. This extension will provide you intellisense for just that. As you start typing a path in quotations, you will get intellisense for directories and file names. This will save you from spending a lot of time in the file explorer

8. Browser Preview : I love the Live Server extension (mentioned above), but his extension goes another step further in terms of convenience. It gives you a live-reloading preview right inside of VS Code. No more having to tab over to your browser to see a small change
